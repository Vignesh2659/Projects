    "5. **Embedding Storage:**\n",
    "   - Inserted generated embeddings into the FAISS index.\n",
    "   - Maintained a mapping between each embedding and its corresponding text document.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Implement Semantic Search:**\n",
    "   - Defined functions to generate query embeddings and perform similarity searches using FAISS.\n",
    "   - Retrieved and displayed corresponding text documents for top matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Testing and Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - Conducted automated testing with various queries.\n",
    "   - Evaluated the relevance of search results through example queries.\n",
    "   - Suggested potential improvements based on testing outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experimented with different similarity search algorithms (cosine similarity vs. Euclidean distance) and compared their performance.\n",
    "- The structure allows for the addition of features like filtering, ranking, or grouping based on relevance scores."
